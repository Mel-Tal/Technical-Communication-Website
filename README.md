Technical-Communication-Website
===============================

Website created as a part of an ARG project for LCC 3403 (Technical Communication) to promote a personal activity monitor. Players of the ARG fall in to one of three catagories: support, human, and zombie. The information displayed on the site changes based on the type of user that is logged in. Note: Creating and connecting to a database of user information was outside of the scope of this project, so to access the part of the site for each of the 3 player types click the corresponding links on the login page.
